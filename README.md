We intend to build a multiplayer game system containing the core features of Risk. Beginning with GUI construction, we will develop a flexible JSON structure to map any desired layout to a visual interface; not to worry, we will provide a few default maps for users to select from when starting the game. Next, we will implement the underlying game features and rules abstracted as data structures and conditions; here, we will represent territories and territory adjacencies as nodes and edges respectively. As part of the game features, we will implement everything from initialization features like territory assignment to gameplay features and conditions including player rounds, probabilistic conquest, troop-movement through connected territories and more. Finally, if our group has time, we will implement an AI-based bot-system to play against users.
